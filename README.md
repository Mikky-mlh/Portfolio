# Portfolio
The Blueprint: A Centralized Source of Truth for my Professional Work.  This repository isn't just a folder of files; it's the backend for my professional identity. It houses the raw data, project histories, and technical assets that power my portfolio. No bloat! Just the essential documentation of what I’ve built and how I built it.
